I used cursor as my AI
- I asked it to build a simple login form
- it was very basic with no styles
- then I asked it to use the styles from the nav-bar as a template for the form styles, and center the form on the page
- I then ran a WAVE test and found that the form was missing visibel labels, so I asked it to add those
- I then ran a lighthouse test and everything came back 100%
- I then checked its responsiveness, which required some media queries, so I asked it to make the page responsive down to the smallest screen width 320px 

All in all it was a very useful tool which saved me a lot of time, I think if I did not have accessibility tools such as WAVE and lighthouse then the page would be less functional. But I will definitely use this tool in the future for the basic layout of my pages.
